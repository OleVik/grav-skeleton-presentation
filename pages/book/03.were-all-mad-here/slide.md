## We're all mad here

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good- natured, she thought: still it had *very* long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

Unlike the previous slides, this Page does not set any universal styles, so it uses the theme from Reveal.js. By default, the plugin has `theme: moon` set.

## Talking to the Cat

### Alice


> ‘Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’

### The Cat

> ‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’

### Alice

> ‘I don’t much care where —’

### The Cat

> ‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go’

[notes]

This slide uses the `data-textsize-scale` and `data-textsize-modifier` shortcodes. If Textsizing is enabled in the plugin, this can be used to dynamically change the size of the headers relative to the body text.

The `data-textsize-modifier`-shortcode proportions the base pixel size for the slide by multiplying with it, whilst `data-textsize-scale` sets the rhythm to apply to headings. The higher the number the scale is, the more distance there will be between header font sizes and the base font size. `1.125` is also known as the Major Second in musical terms, otherwise expressed as "8:9", and yields this particular distance between the headers and the block text.

Base font sizes are determined by the `breakpoints`-option, which matches the breakpoint using `bigger than or equal to` width of the browser's viewpoint, and sets the base font size from the given value.

## Finding her way

> ‘— so long as I get *somewhere* ,’

Alice added as an explanation.

> ‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’

said the Cat,

> ‘if you only walk long enough.’

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. 

> ‘What sort of people live about here?’

To which the Cat replied, waving its paws round,

> ‘In *that* direction, lives a Hatter: and in *that* direction, lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.’

[notes]

The plugin treats content just as Grav does: Using [Parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) to render Markdown content, and Pages to create slides. When a Page contain sections, create by horizontal rules in HTML, it is split up in slides as well.

This and the previous slide has `data-textsize-modifier` set to `0.75`, which means 75% of normal base font size will be applied.
