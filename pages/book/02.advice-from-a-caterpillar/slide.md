## Advice from a Caterpillar

[notes]

The following slides belong to the same Page in Grav, which has declared the following FrontMatter:

```yaml
style:
  color: '#eee8d5'
  background-color: '#be281b'
```

Because the Page declares this, all slides within the Page have the same styles applied.

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself

> The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where *can* I have dropped them, I wonder?

[notes]

Like with [normal Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), Grav -- and hence the Plugin -- supports a syntax that is easy to read and write as normal text.

[fragment="highlight-current-red"]The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.[/fragment]

[fragment="highlight-current-red"]> ‘Who are *you* ?’ said the Caterpillar.[/fragment]

[notes]

This slide uses [fragments](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#fragments), which highlight individual elements on a slide. Each fragment must be wrapped in a `fragment`-shortcode, with no newlines within it -- the syntax does not allow for this currently. You can also pass a fragment-style in as the parameter.

Normal images are rendered as Grav would, but the Plugin centers them automatically.
