## Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland

#### by Lewis Carroll, illustrated by Disney

An example of how the Grav [Presentation](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation)-plugin operates. The plugin source is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation/), as is this [demo content](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation/tree/demo-content). You can also find [usage instructions](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation/tree/master#usage) and [configuration details](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation/tree/master#configuration) there.

[Enable notes](./?showNotes=true) to follow along with how things work.

Great!

Notes are now active; as you can see in the address bar of your browser because it includes `?showNotes=true`. This is one of the query-parameters the plugin uses to manage how the presentation renders.
