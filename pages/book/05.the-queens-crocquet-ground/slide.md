Any content that Grav can render, can generally be used with the plugin. For example [other Shortcodes](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-shortcode-core) or [embedded media](https://learn.getgrav.org/content/media). If you need to add specific assets like CSS or JavaScript to the presentation, use the `presentation`-group when adding them through the [Asset Manager](https://learn.getgrav.org/themes/asset-manager#options), or extend the `presentation.html.twig`-template in your theme.

This slide uses `data-background-*` shortcodes that correspond to the Reveal.js [options for Slide Backgrounds](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#slide-backgrounds), yielding an image as the background for the slide.

Note how `style-background-color=transparent` is used to unset the color that are applied to all slides within this Page, to make sure it does not block out the video.
